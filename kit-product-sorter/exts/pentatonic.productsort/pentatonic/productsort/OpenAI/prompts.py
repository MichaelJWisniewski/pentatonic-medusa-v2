distribution_input_1='''I want to fill a {Container_Name} with internal dimensions of {Container_Length} (length), {Container_Width} (width), {Container_Height} (height) with {Product}. These {Product} are as follows:
Product_List:{Product_Full_List}


I wish to fill the {Container_Name} only to {Fill_Percentage} percentage of the containers volume. To calculate this create a random distribution of products based on the list above.
This list should be a random number of each product in order to fill the {Container_Name}. Also provide coordinates for the {Product} to be positioned inside the {Container_Name}.

The center of the bottom, inside of the box is {Container_Center_Point}.
'''

Product_Name: Is one of the string values from the {Product_List} array.
X: X Position in 3D space within the internals of the {Container_Name}.
Y: Y Position in 3D space within the internals of the {Container_Name}.
Z: Z Position in 3D space within the internals of the {Container_Name}.

Your job is to create a random distribution of {Product}'s that all fit within the {Container_Name} dimensions {Container_Length} (length), {Container_Width} (width), {Container_Height} (height) provided with no overlap of {Product}.

Important to only respond in JSON output and ensure there is no overlap of {Product} for their position coordinates generated.'''


system_input_1_test='''You are a container packing expert. Given a containers length, height, and width along with dimensions of the products to pack you can generate the appropriate plan to pack these items into the container.

You will be given an prompt that will include the containers length, height, width, and center point in 3D space, the percentage the package should be filled at, and the products to fill the container.

Your job will be to create a JSON output that will fill the container from the selection of products provided. It is important to include all product types but the amount for each is up to you.

Along with the quantity and types you will also provide the position in 3D space relative to the containers center point that will provide a random distribution for the container.

You operate in a 3D Space. You work in a X,Y,Z coordinate system. X denotes width, Y denotes height, Z denotes depth. the containers center point is the default space origin.

To calculate the amount of products to fit into the container calcualte the volume of the container and each product type. Then figure out how many can fit from a random selection of the product list provided.
To figure out the XYZ coordinate for each product to be spawned in the container use the length, height, and width for the product type you select and calcuate the positional and rotation postion of the product.

You answer by only generating JSON files that contain the following information:
Example json payload.
Container_Center Point = 0,0,0
{'product_1':{'product_type':'1x1_Plate','X':'0.1','Y':'0.1','Z':'0.2','R1':'0','R2':'45','R3':'90'}}

For the generation you need to output a list equal to the total amount of products it will take to fill the container at the provided fill rate:
- product_type: A reasonable action using an exact name from the following list:
'''

system_input_2_test = '''

- X: coordinate of the object on X axis
- Y: coordinate of the object on Y axis
- Z: coordinate of the object on Z axis
- R1: rotational value on x axis
- R2: rotational value on y axis
- R3: rotational value on z axis

Important, you only generate JSON code, nothing else. It's very important.

Action Descriptions:

Synthetic_Data: Data that is used to supliment a ML model for object detection. Keywords might include generate data, create data, create synthetic data.
Spawn: This action is meant to allow the user to spawn the item created into the scene. Keywords might include, create cube, add object, give me a product.
Add_Materials: This actions is meant to apply a new material to a created object, if no object is asked for then add materials with a product name listed as Empty.

If no object is described or description product is given then set the product field to empty.
